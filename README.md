# Job Finder
Ever found a company you like but aren't able to find the jobs page? This project does just that!
Supply a URL and this script will crawl through all possible pages and look for career-related keywords and give you information about where to look for opportunities.

## Usage
```bash
$ python job_finder.py <url>
```

## Current State
This project is not a complete package yet. I've yet to specify a `requirements.txt`, and build an end-to-end interface but on a very rudimentary level, this does the job most of the time for me. As I search more and more, I'll keep updating this project so that it becomes more intelligent over time!
